============

This repository contains the source code and experiments conducted for the final project on French-to-English translation using deep learning techniques. This project was undertaken as part of our coursework at Université Jean Monnet.

The contributors to this repository are Hedi Zéghidi, Mohamed Moudjahed, and Erick Gomez.

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate different deep learning approaches for French-to-English translation. Various methodologies were explored, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer-based architectures, while experimenting with different hyperparameter settings to assess their impact on performance.

Algorithms and approaches implemented and tested:
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**
- **Transformer Models (e.g., Transformer-based NMT, 
mBART)**
- **Hyperparameter tuning and optimization**

Additionally, various evaluation metrics were used to compare the effectiveness of these approaches.

## Dataset Used for Training and Testing  
The dataset used for training and testing models is the **Parallel Global Voices EN-FR**, which is part of the Global Voices collection:  
[Parallel Global Voices EN-FR on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nicolas-BZRD/Parallel_Global_Voices_English_French)
